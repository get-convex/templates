# Convex Component Template

This is a Convex component, ready to be published on npm.

To create your own component:

1. Write code in src/component for your component. Component-specific tables,
   queries, mutations, and actions go here.
1. Write code in src/client for the Class that interfaces with the component.
   This is the bridge your users will access to get information into and out of
   your component
1. Write example usage in example/convex/example.ts.
1. Delete the text in this readme until `---` and flesh out the README.
1. Publish to npm with `npm run alpha` or `npm run release`.

To develop your component run a dev process in the example project:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

`npm i` will do the install and an initial build. `npm run dev` will start a
file watcher to re-build the component, as well as the example project frontend
and backend, which does codegen and installs the component.

Modify the schema and index files in src/component/ to define your component.

Write a client for using this component in src/client/index.ts.

If you won't be adding frontend code (e.g. React components) to this component
you can delete "./react" references in package.json and "src/react/" directory.
If you will be adding frontend code, add a peer dependency on React in
package.json.

[File it here](https://github.com/example-org/sample-component/issues).

## Installation

Create a `convex.config.ts` file in your app's `convex/` folder and install the
component by calling `use`:

```ts
// convex/convex.config.ts
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";
import sampleComponent from "@example/sample-component/convex.config.js";

const app = defineApp();
app.use(sampleComponent);

export default app;
```

## Usage

```ts
import { components } from "./_generated/api";

export const addComment = mutation({
  args: { text: v.string(), targetId: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.runMutation(components.sampleComponent.lib.add, {
      text: args.text,
      targetId: args.targetId,
      userId: await getAuthUserId(ctx),
    });
  },
});
```

See more example usage in [example.ts](./example/convex/example.ts).

### HTTP Routes

You can register HTTP routes for the component to expose HTTP endpoints:

```ts
import { httpRouter } from "convex/server";
import { registerRoutes } from "@example/sample-component";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";

const http = httpRouter();

registerRoutes(http, components.sampleComponent, {
  pathPrefix: "/comments",
});

export default http;
```

This will expose a GET endpoint that returns the most recent comment as JSON.
The endpoint requires a `targetId` query parameter. See
[http.ts](./example/convex/http.ts) for a complete example.
