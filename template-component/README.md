# Convex Component Template

This is a Convex component, ready to be published on npm.

To create your own component:

1. Run `node rename.mjs` to rename everything to your component's name.
1. Write code in src/component for your component.
1. Write code in src/client for your thick client.
1. Write example usage in example/convex/example.ts.
1. Delete the text in this readme until `---` and flesh out the README.
1. Publish to npm with `npm run alpha` or `npm run release`.

To develop your component run a dev process in the example project:
```sh
npm run setup
npm run dev
```
`setup` will do the install and builds and set up your convex backend (run once).
`dev` will start both a file watcher to re-build the component, as well as run
the example convex project alongside it.



```
npm run dev
```

Modify the schema and index files in src/component/ to define your component.

Write a client for using this component in src/client/index.ts.

If you won't be adding frontend code (e.g. React components) to this
component you can delete the following:

- "./react" exports in package.json
- the "src/react/" directory

If you will be adding frontend code, add a peer dependency on React in package.json.

### Structure of a Convex Component

A Convex components exposes the entry point convex.config.js. The on-disk
location of this file must be a directory containing implementation files. These
files should be compiled to ESM.

In addition to convex.config.js, a component typically exposes a client that
wraps communication with the component for use in the Convex
environment is typically exposed as a named export `MyComponentClient` or
`MyComponent` imported from the root package.

```
import { MyComponentClient } from "my-convex-component";
```

When frontend code is included it is typically published at a subpath:

```
import { helper } from "my-convex-component/react";
import { FrontendReactComponent } from "my-convex-component/react";
```

If you do include frontend components, prefer peer dependencies to avoid using
more than one version of e.g. React.

# Convex Sharded Counter Component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@convex-dev%2Fsharded-counter.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@convex-dev%2Fsharded-counter)

<!-- START: Include on https://convex.dev/components -->

- [ ] What is some compelling syntax as a hook?
- [ ] Why should you use this component?
- [ ] Links to Stack / other resources?

Found a bug? Feature request? [File it here](https://github.com/get-convex/sharded-counter/issues).

## Pre-requisite: Convex

You'll need an existing Convex project to use the component.
Convex is a hosted backend platform, including a database, serverless functions,
and a ton more you can learn about [here](https://docs.convex.dev/get-started).

Run `npm create convex` or follow any of the [quickstarts](https://docs.convex.dev/home) to set one up.

## Installation

Install the component package:

```ts
npm install @convex-dev/sharded-counter
```

Create a `convex.config.ts` file in your app's `convex/` folder and install the component by calling `use`:

```ts
// convex/convex.config.ts
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";
import shardedCounter from "@convex-dev/sharded-counter/convex.config";

const app = defineApp();
app.use(shardedCounter);

export default app;
```

## Usage

```ts
import { components } from "./_generated/api";
import { ShardedCounter } from "@convex-dev/sharded-counter";

const shardedCounter = new ShardedCounter(components.shardedCounter, {
  ...options,
});
```

See more example usage in [example.ts](./example/convex/example.ts).

Run the example:

```sh
npm run setup
npm run example
```
