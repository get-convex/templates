# Convex Component Template

This is a Convex component, ready to be published on npm.

To create your own component:

1. Run `node rename.mjs` to rename everything to your component's name.
1. Write code in src/component for your component.
1. Write code in src/client for the Class that interfaces with the component.
1. Write example usage in example/convex/example.ts.
1. Delete the text in this readme until `---` and flesh out the README.
1. Publish to npm with `npm run alpha` or `npm run release`.

To develop your component run a dev process in the example project:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

`npm i` will do the install and an initial build.
`npm run dev` will start a file watcher to re-build the component, as well as
the example project frontend and backend, which does codegen and installs the
component.

Modify the schema and index files in src/component/ to define your component.

Write a client for using this component in src/client/index.ts.

If you won't be adding frontend code (e.g. React components) to this
component you can delete the following:

- "./react" exports in package.json
- the "src/react/" directory

If you will be adding frontend code, add a peer dependency on React in package.json.

# Convex Sharded Counter Component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@example%2Fsharded-counter.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@example%2Fsharded-counter)

<!-- START: Include on https://convex.dev/components -->

- [ ] Why should you use this component?
- [ ] Links to docs / other resources?

Found a bug? Feature request? [File it here](https://github.com/example-org/sharded-counter/issues).

## Pre-requisite: Convex

You'll need an existing Convex project to use the component.
Convex is a hosted backend platform, including a database, serverless functions,
and a ton more you can learn about [here](https://docs.convex.dev/get-started).

Run `npm create convex` or follow any of the [quickstarts](https://docs.convex.dev/home) to set one up.

## Installation

Install the component package:

```sh
npm install @example/sharded-counter
```

Create a `convex.config.ts` file in your app's `convex/` folder and install the component by calling `use`:

```ts
// convex/convex.config.ts
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";
import shardedCounter from "@example/sharded-counter/convex.config";

const app = defineApp();
app.use(shardedCounter);

export default app;
```

## Usage

```ts
import { components } from "./_generated/api";
import { ShardedCounter } from "@example/sharded-counter";

const shardedCounter = new ShardedCounter(components.shardedCounter, {
  ...options,
});
```

See more example usage in [example.ts](./example/convex/example.ts).

<!-- END: Include on https://convex.dev/components -->

Run the example:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```
