# Convex Component Template

This is a Convex component, ready to be published on npm.

To create your own component:

1. Find and replace "Counter" to your component's Name.
1. Find and replace "counter" to your component's name.
1. Write code in src/component for your component.
1. Write code in src/client for your thick client.
1. Write example usage in example/convex/example.ts.
1. Delete the text in this readme until `---` and flesh out the README.

It is safe to find & replace "counter" project-wide.

To develop your component run a dev process in the example project.

```
npm i
cd example
npm i
npx convex dev
```

Modify the schema and index files in src/component/ to define your component.

Optionally write a client forusing this component in src/client/index.ts.

If you won't be adding frontend code (e.g. React components) to this
component you can delete the following:

- "prepack" and "postpack" scripts of package.json
- "./react" exports in package.json
- the "src/react/" directory
- the "node10stubs.mjs" file

### Structure of a Convex Component

A Convex components exposes the entry point convex.config.js. The on-disk
location of this file must be a directory containing implementation files. These
files should be compiled to ESM.
The package.json should contain `"type": "module"` and the tsconfig.json should
contain `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` or `"Node16"` in order to import other
component definitions.

In addition to convex.config.js, a component typically exposes a client that
wraps communication with the component for use in the Convex
environment is typically exposed as a named export `MyComponentClient` or
`MyComponent` imported from the root package.

```
import { MyComponentClient } from "my-convex-component";
```

When frontend code is included it is typically published at a subpath:

```
import { helper } from "my-convex-component/react";
import { FrontendReactComponent } from "my-convex-component/react";
```

Frontend code should be compiled as CommonJS code as well as ESM and make use of
subpackage stubs (see next section).

If you do include frontend components, prefer peer dependencies to avoid using
more than one version of e.g. React.

### Support for Node10 module resolution

The [Metro](https://reactnative.dev/docs/metro) bundler for React Native
requires setting
[`resolver.unstable_enablePackageExports`](https://metrobundler.dev/docs/package-exports/)
in order to import code that lives in `dist/esm/react.js` from a path like
`my-convex-component/react`.

Authors of Convex component that provide frontend components are encouraged to
support these legacy "Node10-style" module resolution algorithms by generating
stub directories with special pre- and post-pack scripts.

# Convex Counter Component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@convex-dev%2Fcounter.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@convex-dev%2Fcounter)

**Note: Convex Components are currently in beta**

<!-- START: Include on https://convex.dev/components -->

- [ ] Why should you use this component?
- [ ] Links to Stack / other resources?

Found a bug? Feature request? [File it here](https://github.com/get-convex/counter/issues).

## Pre-requisite: Convex

You'll need an existing Convex project to use the component.
Convex is a hosted backend platform, including a database, serverless functions,
and a ton more you can learn about [here](https://docs.convex.dev/get-started).

Run `npm create convex` or follow any of the [quickstarts](https://docs.convex.dev/home) to set one up.

## Installation

Install the component package:

```ts
npm install @convex-dev/foo
```

Create a `convex.config.ts` file in your app's `convex/` folder and install the component by calling `use`:

```ts
// convex/convex.config.ts
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";
import counter from "@convex-dev/counter/convex.config";

const app = defineApp();
app.use(counter);

export default app;
```

## Usage

```ts
import { components } from "./_generated/api";
import { Counter } from "@convex-dev/counter";

const counter = new Counter(components.counter, {
  ...options,
});
```

See more example usage in [example.ts](./example/convex/example.ts).
