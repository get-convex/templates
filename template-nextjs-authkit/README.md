# Welcome to your Convex + Next.js + WorkOS AuthKit app

This is a [Convex](https://convex.dev/) project migrated to use WorkOS AuthKit for authentication.

After the initial setup (<2 minutes) you'll have a working full-stack app using:

- Convex as your backend (database, server logic)
- [React](https://react.dev/) as your frontend (web page interactivity)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for optimized web hosting and page routing
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for building great looking accessible UI
- [WorkOS AuthKit](https://authkit.com/) for authentication

## Get started

1. Clone this repository and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
3. Configure WorkOS AuthKit:
   - Create a [WorkOS account](https://workos.com/)
   - Get your Client ID and API Key from the WorkOS dashboard
   - In the WorkOS dashboard, add `http://localhost:3000/callback` as a redirect URI
   - Generate a secure password for cookie encryption (minimum 32 characters)
   - Update your `.env.local` file with these values

4. Configure Convex:

   ```bash
   npx convex dev
   ```

   This will:
   - Set up your Convex deployment
   - Add your Convex URL to `.env.local`
   - Open the Convex dashboard

   Then configure WorkOS authentication in Convex:

   ```bash
   npx convex auth add workos
   ```

   This creates `convex/auth.config.ts` with WorkOS integration

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This starts both the Next.js frontend and Convex backend in parallel

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your app

## WorkOS AuthKit Setup

This app uses WorkOS AuthKit for authentication. Key features:

- **Redirect-based authentication**: Users are redirected to WorkOS for sign-in/sign-up
- **Session management**: Automatic token refresh and session handling
- **Middleware protection**: Routes are protected using Next.js middleware
- **Client and server hooks**: `useAuth()` for client components, `withAuth()` for server components
