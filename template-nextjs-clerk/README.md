# Welcome to your Convex + Next.js + Clerk app

This is a [Convex](https://convex.dev/) project created with [`npm create convex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-convex).

After the initial setup (<2 minutes) you'll have a working full-stack app using:

- Convex as your backend (database, server logic)
- [React](https://react.dev/) as your frontend (web page interactivity)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for optimized web hosting and page routing
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for building great looking accessible UI
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for authentication

## Get started

If you just cloned this codebase and didn't use `npm create convex`, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you're reading this README on GitHub and want to use this template, run:

```
npm create convex@latest -- -t nextjs-clerk
```

Then:

1. Open your app. There should be a "Claim your application" button from Clerk in the bottom right of your app.
2. Follow the steps to claim your application and link it to this app.
3. Follow step 3 in the [Convex Clerk onboarding guide](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk#get-started) to create a Convex JWT template.
4. Uncomment the Clerk provider in `convex/auth.config.ts`
5. Paste the Issuer URL as `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` to your dev deployment environment variable settings on the Convex dashboard (see [docs](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk#configuring-dev-and-prod-instances))

If you want to sync Clerk user data via webhooks, check out this [example repo](https://github.com/thomasballinger/convex-clerk-users-table/).
