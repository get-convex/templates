# Welcome to your Convex + React (Vite) + Clerkapp

This is a [Convex](https://convex.dev/) project created with [`npm create convex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-convex).

After the initial setup (<2 minutes) you'll have a working full-stack app using:

- Convex as your backend (database, server logic)
- [React](https://react.dev/) as your frontend (web page interactivity)
- [Vite](https://vitest.dev/) for optimized web hosting
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for building great looking accessible UI
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for authentication

## Get started

If you just cloned this codebase and didn't use `npm create convex`, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you're reading this README on GitHub and want to use this template, run:

```
npm create convex@latest -- -t react-vite-clerk
```

Then:

1. Follow steps 1 to 3 in the [Clerk onboarding guide](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk#get-started)
2. Paste the Issuer URL as `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` to your dev deployment environment variable settings on the Convex dashboard (see [docs](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk#configuring-dev-and-prod-instances))
3. Paste your publishable key as `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="<your publishable key>"` to the `.env.local` file in this directory.
