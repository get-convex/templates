# Welcome to your Convex + React (Vite) + Convex Auth app

This is a [Convex](https://convex.dev/) project created with [`npm create convex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-convex).

After the initial setup (<2 minutes) you'll have a working full-stack app using:

- Convex as your backend (database, server logic)
- [React](https://react.dev/) as your frontend (web page interactivity)
- [Vite](https://vitest.dev/) for optimized web hosting
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for building great looking UI
- [Convex Auth](https://labs.convex.dev/auth) for authentication

## Get started

If you just cloned this codebase and didn't use `npm create convex`, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you're reading this README on GitHub and want to use this template, run:

```
npm create convex@latest -- -t react-vite-convexauth
```

For more information on how to configure Convex Auth, check out the [Convex Auth docs](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/).

For more examples of different Convex Auth flows, check out this [example repo](https://www.convex.dev/templates/convex-auth).
